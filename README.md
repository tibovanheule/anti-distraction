# anti-distraction
A git repo with a all the sites to block to be 100% productive during study times.

I found myself browsing youtube and other sites to much and they mostly prevent you from getting the work doen.
That's why i  decided to at those sites to my host file, to redirect them.

Simple add the file contents to your hosts file.

## note!
This isn't a host file intended to block ad's! 
It's meant to be an temporary host file to block sites when you need to be productive!
